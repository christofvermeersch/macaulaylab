            We present the MATLAB toolbox MacaulayLab, which provides numerical linear algebra algorithms for solving multivariate polynomial systems and rectangular multiparameter eigenvalue problems.
            Some core features of MacaulayLab are the fact that it solves two key problems via a common approach, works independently of the chosen polynomial basis and monomial ordering, and is capable of dealing with positive-dimensional solution sets at infinity.
            The toolbox has been developed to be user-friendly and easy to use, whether the user simply wants to solve a problem or wants to learn more about its properties. 
            This website contains, next to the toolbox and its documentation, many examples and highlights of research that uses the toolbox.
